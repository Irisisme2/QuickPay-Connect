## Concept ðŸš€

QuickPay Connect is a platform enabling fast and easy payments using the GHO token. The project is based on a ready-made financial app template, customized and extended to integrate GHO-based payments.

## Features:

- **Easy Integration with GHO:** Integrate features that enable users to easily use the GHO token for making payments.

- **Transaction Signing:** Utilize various transaction signing methods, such as permit and creditDelegationWithSignature, to ensure secure and authorized transactions.

- **Support for Smart Contract Wallets:** Add support for smart contract wallets compliant with EIP 4337, allowing more advanced fund management.

- **Vaults for Secure Storage:** Utilize smart contract vaults to create a secure storage space for GHO tokens for users, groups, or protocols.

- **New Facilitators for GHO:** Propose potential new facilitators for GHO that may be considered by Aave DAO. Ensure they are based on smart contract agreements, securing reserves, and using oracles to confirm their status.

- **Integration with Chainlink CCIP:** Utilize Chainlink CCIP in projects related to GHO payments to provide interoperability across chains.

- **ConnectKit in User Interface:** Use ConnectKit to create an attractive and intuitive user interface for your application, making it easy to use.

## Additional Notes:

To comply with the rule of using a ready-made template, start with a ready-made financial app template and customize it according to the mentioned functionalities.

Provide comprehensive documentation and a demo video showing all added features and how the project meets the hackathon requirements.

Focus on innovative solutions, such as interesting transaction signing methods, new use cases for the GHO token, or creative integrations with Chainlink CCIP.
